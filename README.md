# Dhaka-Park-Distribution
This Project shows the park distribuition in Dhaka city upazillas 
Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing megacity in Asia. Dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world (Hailong et al., 2021). Dhaka has been facing rapid expansion because of massive urbanization in last three
decades. At present, Dhaka urban sprawl extends in its six Thanas (Thana:smaller
administrative unit of a city in Bangladesh) from northern Thana Savar to its
sounthernmost Thana Dohar. This rapid urban growth has forced unplanned
development of commercial, residential and industrial area in the outskirts of city. But with the same proportion other necessary settlements i.e. parks, hospitals, schools has not been developed. The lack of urban green space, low accessibility of
parks and the deficit of their eco-efficiency, all these have influence on the quality of
human living environment (Min et al., 2011). For a quality of urban living parks are
necessary amenities. But rapid urban development in developing countries often
overlook this amenity inclusion while expanding the urban dynamics in outskirt of
cities. The Dhaka centric economic growth has attracted more population to this city
and forced Dhaka to expand spatially even develop industries in Savar and
Keraniganj. However, Savar and Keraniganj has industrial and residential setting but
not have adequate amenities like parks in that setting for city dwelller. This study
intends to explore the Thana wise park distribution of Dhaka city. This study wants
to show a overview of Dhaka city amenities (i.e. park) distribution to newly
expanded urban area such as Savar, Keraniganj.
